===============================

The goal of this game is for your player to reach the water without colliding with an enemy bug.  If your character collides with an an enemy bug, (s)he dies, and is returned to the starting position.  If your character reaches the water, (s)he drowns, and is returned to the starting position.

You may choose among five different characters by pressing the letter 'p' until you find a character you like.

Pressing the up-arrow moves the character upward, left-arrow leftward, right-arrow rightward, and bottom-arrow downward.  Your character cannot leave the board.

Enemies, once they walk past the right-most side of the screen, will reappear on the left-hand side.

Good luck!
